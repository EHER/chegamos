/**
 * The `Form` adapter provides basic authentication facilities for checking credentials submitted
 * via a web form against a database. To perform an authentication check, the adapter accepts
 * an instance of a `Request` object which contains the submitted form data in its `$data` property.
 *
 * When a request is submitted, the adapter will take the form data from the `Request` object,
 * apply any filters as appropriate (see the `'filters'` configuration setting below), and
 * query a model class using using the filtered data.
 *
 * By default, the adapter uses a model called `User`, and lookup fields called `'username'` and
 * `'password'`. These can be customized by setting the `'model'` and `'fields'` configuration keys,
 * respectively. The `'model'` key accepts either a model name (i.e. `Customer`), or a
 * fully-namespaced path to a model class (i.e. `\app\models\Customer`). The `'fields'` setting
 * accepts an array of field names to use when looking up a user. An example configuration,
 * including a custom model class and lookup fields might look like the following:
 * {{{
 * 	Auth::config(array(
 * 		'customer' => array(
 * 			'adapter' => 'Form',
 * 			'model' => 'Customer',
 * 			'fields' => array('email', 'password')
 * 		)
 * 	));
 * }}}
 *
 * If the field names present in the form match the fields used in the database lookup, the above
 * will suffice. If, however, the form fields must be matched to non-standard database column names,
 * you can specify an array which matches up the form field names to their corresponding database
 * column names. Suppose, for example, user authentication information in a MongoDB database is
 * nested within a sub-object called `login`. The adapter could be configured as follows:
 * {{{
 * 	Auth::config(array(
 * 		'customer' => array(
 * 			'adapter' => 'Form',
 * 			'model' => 'Customer',
 * 			'fields' => array('username' => 'login.username', 'password' => 'login.password'),
 * 			'scope' => array('active' => true)
 * 		)
 * 	));
 * }}}
 *
 * Note that any additional fields may be specified which should be included in the query. For
 * example, if a user must select a group when logging in, you may override the `'fields'` key with
 * that value as well (i.e. `'fields' => array('username', 'password', 'group')`; note that if a
 * field is specified which is not present in the request, the value in the query will be `null`).
 * However, this will only submit data that is specified in the incoming request. If you would like
 * to further limit the query using fixed data, use the `'scope'` key, as shown in the example
 * above.
 *
 * As mentioned, prior to any queries being executed, the request data is modified by any filters
 * configured. Filters are callbacks which accept the value of a field as input, and return a
 * modified version of the value as output. Filters can be any PHP callable, i.e. a closure or
 * `array('ClassName', 'method')`. The only filter that is configured by default is for
 * the password field, which is filtered by `lithium\util\String::hash()`.
 *
 * Note that if you are specifying the `'fields'` configuration using key/value pairs, the key
 * used to specify the filter must match the key side of the `'fields'` assignment.
